### Data Structure

You are given the following mock data presented in the following format:

```ts
[
  {
    id: 'b2DZoZvr2WEwq8px3Fuca', // ID of the invoice
    shipment: {
      id: '_7pRBN49W3qbIsdiqzYoZ', // ID of the shipment
      createdAt: '2025-10-30T04:01:45.903Z', // date when the shipment was created
      trackingNumber: '208669628341', // tracking number generated by the carrier
      company: {
        id: 'fGZvzkW7AW696vc97qb1-', // ID of the company registered to the Delivro app
        name: 'Lynch - Bartoletti', // name of the registered company
      },
      provider: 'GLS', // possible providers are GLS, DPD, UPS, PPL, FedEx
      mode: 'EXPORT', // considered an 'EXPORT' if origin country is strictly equal to CZ, otherwise it is always an 'IMPORT'
      originCountry: 'CZ', // ISO code of the origin country
      destinationCountry: 'GP', // ISO code of the destination country
    },
    invoicedWeight: 9.9, // units in KG
    invoicedPrice: 302, // units in CZK
  },
];
```

When a corrected invoice is given to us by the carrier, it will contain the same shipment object but a different invoice ID and of course a corrected `invoicedWeight` or `invoicedPrice`. In such case, you are expected to simply update the existing shipment with the new values instead of creating a new entry.
